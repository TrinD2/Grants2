Please explain how your project meets the Climate Solutions Round eligibility criteria.

Our project, Ethereum Bolivia's Climate Impact Initiative, is in perfect alignment with the eligibility criteria outlined for the Climate Coordination Network's grant round:

Projects Must Be at Least 3 Months Old: Our initiative meets this requirement, as we've been actively engaged in community-building for over a year. From organizing educational workshops to hosting Bolivia's first blockchain hackathon, our track record demonstrates our commitment to driving positive change over an extended period.

Focus on Climate Solutions: Our grant proposal is primarily focused on addressing climate challenges in Bolivia through community-driven clean-up events and blockchain education. By explicitly outlining how our project will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering environmental sustainability, we aim to align closely with the goals of the Climate Coordination Network.

Prior Funding Updates: As returning grantees, we're eager to provide new updates on our progress and impact. We'll share insights into the challenges we've faced and the lessons we've learned from previous initiatives. Additionally, we'll outline how the additional funding from this round will enable us to meet our upcoming goals, including expanding our reach, enhancing our educational offerings, and organizing more impactful community events.

Viability and Practicality: Our project is firmly within the realm of viability, with practical and achievable goals based on our team's expertise, resources, and current technological capabilities. We've demonstrated our credibility through past successes, and we're genuinely committed to building on our momentum to drive meaningful change in Bolivia's climate landscape.

By meeting these eligibility criteria, we believe that our project is well-positioned to make a significant impact within the Climate Coordination Network's grant round. We look forward to the opportunity to further our mission of accelerating climate solutions through blockchain technology and community action.

If you've received funding in past grant rounds, please share any new updates or milestones from the prior months. You can also include the challenges you've faced.

We're excited to share the latest updates and milestones from Ethereum Bolivia's recent activities:

Over the past months, we've been actively engaged in organizing monthly talks across two cities, covering a wide range of topics relevant to the blockchain ecosystem. From discussions on the importance of programming skills to practical introductions to zkRollups and Scroll, we've remained dedicated to providing informative and educational content to our community.

Despite encountering challenges, such as the lack of accessible venues for our educational activities in both La Paz and Santa Cruz, we've taken proactive steps to address these obstacles.

In La Paz, we've forged an alliance with the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés, one of the largest universities in the country, to utilize designated spaces provided by the Computer Science Department. This partnership enables us to deliver free educational content to their students and our community.

Similarly, in Santa Cruz, we're finalizing an interinstitutional agreement with the Universidad Privada del Valle as part of our preparations for the Ethereum Bolivia 2024 Buildathon event. This agreement allows us to organize complimentary educational events in designated spaces for students of the university.

These partnerships not only grant us access to a wider audience but also engage significant educational stakeholders in the country, fostering a broader movement towards blockchain application and solutions development.

Additionally, we've recently transitioned our educational approach to a more practical and hands-on format. By creating vibrant and interactive learning environments, participants can now engage directly with blockchain tools and technologies, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. This shift aims to inspire curiosity and empower individuals to explore the blockchain ecosystem beyond our events.

In April, we initiated practical workshops in collaboration with the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz and hosted a workshop in Santa Cruz on Public Goods and Opportunities in Web3, led by Nouns Amigos. These workshops have garnered enthusiastic participation, with newcomers expressing eagerness to delve deeper into blockchain technology and practical tools.

Looking ahead, we're gearing up for the next phase of our initiative: professional training in Solidity programming and project ideation, culminating in the second edition of our blockchain buildathon, "Ethereum Bolivia 2024."

With each new milestone, we're energized by the enthusiasm and dedication of our community. Together, we're forging a brighter future powered by blockchain technology and collective innovation!
